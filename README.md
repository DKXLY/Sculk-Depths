## THIS MOD IS IN ALPHA, THINGS MAY CHANGE!

# Sculk Depths

# Important Notes

- The 1.20 release no longer supports worlds created with older versions. The file "biome3.json" has been removed, causing biome3 to revert to plains. This change does not affect the 1.19 releases, where this biome will continue to be supported (for now).

# ABOUT
This mod adds a new dimension called "Sculk Depths" to Minecraft.

To access this dimension, follow these steps:

1. Search for a deep dark biome with an ancient city.
2. Summon and defeat a Warden to obtain its new drop, the Soul Heart.
3. Clear all the sculk veins from the middle of the reinforced deepslate in the center of the city.
4. Use the Soul Heart to light the portal.

When entering this dimension, it is recommended to bring a netherite pickaxe as the dimension is mostly made of a very hard block called Umbrusk.

## FEATURES

- New dimension with custom world generation.
- Four new biomes.
- A new structure (work in progress).
